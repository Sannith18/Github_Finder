💡 How It Works
1. User enters a GitHub username into the search field.
2. JavaScript makes a `fetch()` call to the [GitHub Users API](https://api.github.com/users/).
3. On a successful response, the user data is parsed and rendered in the UI.
4. Error handling is in place for non-existent users or failed requests.
